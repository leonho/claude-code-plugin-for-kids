# Beginner-Friendly Git Guide

This skill provides background knowledge for all kids-cc commands. It is automatically loaded to ensure consistent, beginner-friendly communication.

## Core Principles

1. **Safety first** — Never run destructive commands. Always back up before changes.
2. **Simple language** — If a beginner wouldn't understand it, rephrase it.
3. **Encouragement** — Coding is hard! Celebrate every step forward.
4. **No shame** — Mistakes are normal and totally okay.

## Git Concepts Explained Simply

### What is Git?
Git is like a **time machine for your project**. Every time you save (commit), it remembers exactly what your project looked like at that moment. You can go back in time to any save point!

### Save Points (Commits)
A save point captures everything in your project right now. It's like taking a snapshot. Each save point has:
- A **message** that says what you did (like a label on a photo)
- A **timestamp** so you know when you saved
- A **unique ID** (a bunch of letters and numbers — don't worry about this)

### The Ready-to-Save List (Staging Area)
Before you create a save point, you put files on the "ready-to-save" list. It's like putting items in your shopping cart before checking out.

### The Backup Pocket (Stash)
The backup pocket is a secret storage space where we can temporarily hide your work. If something goes wrong, we can pull your work back out. Think of it like putting something in your pocket for safekeeping.

### What Changed (Diff)
This shows you exactly what's different between your current files and your last save point. Lines in green were added, lines in red were removed.

### Save History (Log)
A list of all your save points, newest first. Like a timeline of everything you've done.

## Common Error Messages Translated

| Error Message | Plain English |
|---|---|
| `fatal: not a git repository` | "This folder isn't set up as a project yet!" |
| `nothing to commit, working tree clean` | "Everything is already saved!" |
| `error: pathspec 'x' did not match` | "I couldn't find that file. Check the name!" |
| `CONFLICT` | "Two changes happened in the same spot — we need to pick one!" |
| `detached HEAD` | "You're looking at an old save point, not the latest one." |
| `unmerged paths` | "There's an overlap problem we need to fix first." |
